Initiation Phase

We need to make sure all notes that show underneath the fields are updated. Can leave them and we give notes later, or do it with no notes and then we add them later. 

Intake: 
  -	Skip initiation for Mods – Go directly to Planning
  -	IT Lead going away. Can we get it so it’s not required on Project Details page? 

Discovery: 
  -	Move after IT Sizing section
  - Take out the “Systems Impacted” field.
  -	“Requirements Timeline” need to be changed to “CCB Planning Presentation Date” and be a date field.
  -	Add “Requirements Completion Date” date field
  -	Add “Schedule Completion Date” date field
  -	Move the scoring to its own list (between Deliverables and IT Sizing). 
    o	ePMO needs to be able to update the scoring. 
    o	Make “TriWest Strategic Goals” become “Leadership Priority”
      	Can we have it pull in from the intake form? 
  -	Add a “Notes” field

Vendors (optional): 
  -	Only the top four fields are needed in initiation phase. Can we hide the rest until Planning?

  -	What is the project field below “Primary Representatives” on the new look version? 

Stakeholder Benefits:
  -	Add the “Save and Add” button to prevent it taking them to the beginning each time. 
  -	Stakeholder field should allow multiple selections.   
  -	What is the project field below “Primary Representatives” on the new look version? 

Deliverables:
  -	Add the “Save and Add” button to prevent it taking them to the beginning each time.
